## 🚀 Part 3. Using Features

### 1. Automatic Tree Enrichment

As soon as you visit YFull.com, the extension automatically recognizes sample IDs and overlays a layer of genealogical data.

*   **Before:** Only code (e.g., `YF143588`).
*   **After:** Colored chip with surname, ethnicity, region, and national flag.

<img width="678" height="636" alt="Example of enriched YFull tree with surnames and flags" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea74875c-ddf3-4299-a24d-20f06b2c15f0" />

> [!NOTE]
> The extension **does not modify** YFull's scientific data. It only adds a visual layer with genealogical information over the existing interface.

---

### 2. Adding Data (Contribution)

You can help the community by adding information about a sample you know:

1. Find a sample with a gray **[+]** icon (this means there's no data yet).

   <img width="631" height="167" alt="Sample without data with add button" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a8bd265-0906-44ba-86ad-42ae6e6d8246" />

2. Click on **[+]**. You'll be redirected to the data entry form.

3. Select the record type (**Y-DNA tree** or **mtDNA tree**) at the top of the site.

4. Fill in the fields:
   - **Surname**
   - **Tribe/Ethnicity**

   <img width="1351" height="538" alt="Genealogical data entry form" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3c7fe6a-b9c0-466b-9e8b-879d92b96661" />

5. Click on **"Additional Information"** to specify extended data (village, historical region, additional info).

6. Click **Submit**. The data will appear on the site for all users **instantly**!

---

### 3. Anonymous Contribution (Shadow Profile)

If you want to share data but remain anonymous:

*   In the entry form, check the **"Make Anonymous"** box.
*   Your contribution will be saved, but in the change history it will be marked as **"Anonymous"**.
*   **Important:** Anonymity only hides your name as the author. The genealogical data itself (surname, ethnicity) remains public for the benefit of the entire community.

---

### 4. Personal Dashboard (Web Portal)

Manage your contributions through the web portal [**yfinder.vercel.app**](https://yfinder.vercel.app):

*   **📊 Dashboard:** Statistics of your additions.
*   **📝 My Samples:** List of all samples you've added with quick search and filtering.
